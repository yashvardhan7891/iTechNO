                    . We included a few additional games that you may be curious about. Keep in mind, however, that
                    these values can be affected by a number of things. Patches, updates, and voice calls can increase
                    the data used. Plus, if you game quite a bit, the numbers will add up in your monthly data usage
                    total. Here’s a chart outlining the data usage per hour for the most popular online games:
                    Game Title Avg. Data Used Per Hour
                    Fortnite 100MB
                    Destiny 2 300MB
                    Overwatch 135MB
                    Minecraft 40MB-200MB
                    Diablo 3 16MB (single-player) 26MB (multiplayer)
                    World of Warcraft 40MB
                    League of Legends 45MB
                    Grand Theft Auto V Online 60MB
                    Dota 2 120MB
                    Team Fortress 2 80MB
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive 250MB
                    Call of Duty: World War II 40MB
                    Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 80MBAs you can see, even the data-hungry online games don’t use up that
                    much data. In fact, two factors that might increase the data spent per hour are voice chatting and
                    patches. If you’re playing a multiplayer campaign, you may want to use live voice chat to create
                    strategies and keep up with your team. Some games include this feature, and others require that you
                    use programs like Skype, TeamSpeak, or Discord. To give you an approximate idea of how much
                    additional data voice chatting occupies, Skype calls can take anywhere between 13 to 45MB per hour.
                    And this value is based on a 2-person call – once you add more team members, the data usage
                    increases also. The other feature of games that uses up data while
                    gaming is updates and patches. Even if you’re playing a single-player game, or a game that’s not
                    played online, your game will need to use internet data to download new patches
